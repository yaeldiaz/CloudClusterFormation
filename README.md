# CloudClusterFormation
Modelling the formation of cloud clusters described by the Hottovy-Stechmann stochastic differential equation (SDE), which is described in detail the following reference:
Stechmann, S. N., and S. Hottovy (2016), Cloud regimes as phase transitions, Geophys. Res. Lett., 43, 6579–6587, doi:10.1002/2016GL069396.
The code contained in the Python notebook allows to simulate the Hottovy Stechmann SDE for different values of the parameters in order to observe the evolution of cloud cluster formation for different phases.
The resulting simulations for the shallow cumulus, open cells and closed cells regime are shown as gif files in the GIFs folder.
